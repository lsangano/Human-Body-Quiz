# Human-Body-Quiz
The Purpose of this coding assignment was to create a timed multiple choice quiz that various javascript functions as well as usage of local storage.

The criteria that needed to be met included the start button immediately starting the quiz, another question immediately being presented after the other, the subtraction of time from the timer when a question is answered incorrectly, game over is achieved when all questions are answered or time is up and finally initials and score can be saved.

All of these criteria were met by using various functions, eventlisteners, queryselectors, local storage calls and object-arrays. The program saves initials locally even after refresh and can be accessed until they are cleared from storage.

## User Story
